Spring Boot and JPA CRUD Project.

# JPACRUDProject


#Skills Applied This application provided a good opportunity to practice several of the skills taught during week seven such as: JDBC, relational databases, MySQL, and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).

#Challenges and Lessons Learned

After developing and Forward-engineering the database, my biggest challenge was getting the CRUD operations working. Throughout the course of completing this assignment, I had to spend several hours chasing errors.  Once these errors were resolved, however, I continued to experience several coding challenges. One challenge involved passing information between the DAO, controller and JSP.
